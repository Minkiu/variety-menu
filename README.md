# variety-menu
Add a menu to your GNOME Shell for the application Variety.

## Installation
I plan on submitting this to the GNOME Shell Extension website once I refined it a bit more.
Download or Clone the repo, create a folder under `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` i.e: `variety-menu` and drop the contents of the repo inside that folder; then simply restart your Shell (Under Xorg: Alt+F2 -> r).
