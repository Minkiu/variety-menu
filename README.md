# Variety Menu
Add a menu to your GNOME Shell for the application [Variety](https://github.com/varietywalls/variety).

## Installation
I plan on submitting this to the GNOME Shell Extension website.

Download or Clone the repo, copy the folder `variety-menu@oscardomingo.com` into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`; then restart your GNOME-Shell (Under Xorg: Alt+F2 -> r), then you will be able to enable it through GNOME Tweaks > Extensions.
